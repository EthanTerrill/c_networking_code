# Self signed HTTPS server in c 
This is a pretty simple project I put together over the course of a few weeks
the main idea here is to make an HTTPS server in c, as of right now the server uses
self signed certification whcih isnt great security wise but its better than HTTP, 
in the future I'll likely add more secruity features and a config file for a server
